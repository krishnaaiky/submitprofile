This AI-driven project aims to simplify the job application process by automatically generating tailored cover letter emails. By providing a job posting portal link, the system analyzes the job description and cross-references it with the user's profile to create a customized cover letter. Developed using Python, the project utilizes Llama AI to enhance the content creation process, ensuring that the cover letters are well-crafted and aligned with the job requirements. This solution streamlines the application workflow, offering job seekers a smart, efficient way to apply for positions.
